## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm currently studying Computer Science & Business @ Northeastern University. I'm interested in using technology to develop winning business strategies and design creative interdisciplinary solutions for human challenges. Climate change, food and energy waste, unsustainable business practices -- let's figure this stuff out!

Feel free to reach out at allan.tr@northeastern.edu.
